  <h2 class='c003'>BOSTON ELEVATED RAILWAY RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c004'>The transportation system of the city of Boston comprises a combination of both
rapid transit and surface lines operated under a single fare arrangement with transfer
privileges permitting a continuous ride in one general direction from one end to
the other of the system. The elevated lines and the Tremont St. Subway were originally
built by the railway company in 1901. Today the total transportation system includes
more than 500 miles of line of which
37 miles are subway and elevated
tracks. The population served in the
district of more than 92 square miles
is considerably over a million people
and the number of revenue passengers
carried, approximates 350,000,000 per
year. Statistics are not available as
to the passengers carried on the
Rapid Transit lines.</p>

<div  class='figleft id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Exterior of Main Power Station at South Boston</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The original elevated structure
operated between Sullivan Sq.,
Charlestown, and Dudley Street,
with two branches through the city,
one by subway under Tremont St. and
the other by the way of Atlantic Ave.
and South Station. In 1908-9 the
elevated structure was extended to
the present terminal at Forest Hills
and the Washington St. Subway was
completed through the business part
of the city. The Cambridge Subway
was placed in operation in 1912. Recent extensions include an elevated line from Sullivan
Square to Everett and reconstruction of the tunnel to East Boston.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since July 1, 1919, the system has been operated by the Board of Trustees of the
Commonwealth. Under the direction of this board are included not only the details of
operation and management, but also the decisions as to fares to be charged independent of
the State Department of Public Utilities.</p>

<p class='c005'>Under the direction of the present management a continuous program of improvements
has been inaugurated which has necessitated the re-routing of trains to handle the
traffic to the best advantage.</p>

<div class='clear'>

<p class='c005'>Briefly there are four main routes as follows:</p>

</div>
<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'>Forest Hills-Everett (via tunnel)</td>
    <td class='c007'>8.59 miles</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'>Forest Hills-Everett (via elev.)</td>
    <td class='c007'>9.35 miles</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'>Harvard-Andrew</td>
    <td class='c007'>5.56 miles</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'>No. Station West-Kenmore</td>
    <td class='c007'>2.87 miles</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'>Bowdoin-Maverick Sq.</td>
    <td class='c007'>1.67 miles</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>The Forest Hills-Everett route is called the main line, and the Harvard-Andrew
route the Cambridge Subway. The Bowdoin-Maverick Square line up to the present has
been operating three-car trains with overhead trolley, but new equipment consisting of
steel cars is now on order and the third rail is now being installed in the tunnel. The
Lechmere Sq.-Broadway line over East Cambridge Viaduct and Tremont St. Subway is
also considered a rapid transit route, although surface type cars are used with overhead
trolley. These cars are equipped for multiple unit control and are operated in three-car
trains.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>35,000-Kw. Turbo-Generator in South Boston Power Station</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The rush hour trains on the main line include as high as eight cars, which is the limit
set by the length of the station platforms. The signal system is entirely automatic and
during rush hours the headway varies from 2 to 3½ minutes on the main line. The
maximum grades encountered are 2 to 3 percent with a high percentage of heavy curvature.
By taking advantage of the transfer arrangements at terminals, rides of 14 miles can be
obtained for a single fare.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Power Station Equipment</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>The power system as originally installed included several engine-driven direct-current
plants suitably located for distributing 600 volts direct to the trolley. With the extension
of the system, however, an alternating-current station was installed at South Boston,
generating 25-cycle three-phase current for distribution at 13,200 volts to synchronous converter
substations. Alternating-current generating equipment has also been installed at
the Lincoln Station. The total installed capacity of turbine stations is now 115,000 kw.
while the direct-current generating stations have practically all been discontinued.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Substations</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>There are in operation for supplying power to both elevated and surface lines a total
of 12 synchronous converter substations having a total rated capacity of 58,000 kw. The
power consumption of the Rapid Transit lines is somewhat less than half the total
energy used.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Distribution</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Direct current is distributed from the several substations at 600 volts and is collected
on the rapid transit systems from an 85-lb. over-running third rail.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Rolling Stock</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>Altogether there are 420 cars in the rapid transit service, the older cars weighing
about 34 tons with seating capacity of 48 and the newer type as used in the Cambridge
Subway 43 tons each, arranged to seat 72 passengers. On account of the limiting clearances
in the old subway the Cambridge cars cannot be used on the main line. All cars are
motor cars and no attempt is made to use trailers. Each car is equipped with two motors
and multiple unit control.</p>

  <h2 class='c003'>BROOKLYN RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c004'>The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company controls all of the elevated and surface lines in
Brooklyn including those reaching Coney Island. It also has entrance to Manhattan
over the lines of the New York Municipal Railway Corporation, which was
organized by the B.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;T. to finance and construct a part of the new city lines allotted to
the B.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;T. The New York Municipal line runs through the new Broadway subway as
far north as 60th St. thence east through the 60th St. tunnel under the East River to a connection
with the Astoria and Corona lines in Queens. Other subway and bridge routes
have been completed during the past few years as part of a definite plan, which contemplates
the elimination of the present stub end operation at the lower end of Manhattan.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Standard New York Municipal Motor Car Equipped with GE-248 Motors</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Brooklyn Bridge line built in 1883 and the Brooklyn Elevated R.&nbsp;R. in 1888
formed the nucleus of the present Brooklyn Rapid Transit system. Electrical equipment
was tried out in 1898 and additional motor cars were put in service in 1902. This
improvement rapidly displaced the “steam dummies” and facilitated the extension of lines
and the handling of a rapidly increasing traffic.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of the present lines on the Brooklyn Rapid Transit system 89.20 miles of route aggregating
258.35 miles on a single track basis can be classed as rapid transit lines and operate
multiple unit trains with third rail current collection. This includes the several elevated
branches in Brooklyn and the newer subway lines of the dual system all of which are
operated by the New York Consolidated R.&nbsp;R. Co., which is the operating organization.</p>

<p class='c005'>The lines of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit system, which are operated by the New
York Consolidated R.&nbsp;R., according to figures for the year ended June 30, 1921, handled
404,970,640 passengers over the rapid transit lines.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Power Supply</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>The original power equipment consisted of engine-driven direct-current generators,
which have gradually been retired due to obsolescence.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Power for operating the B.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;T. system is now generated in two alternating-current
plants with installed capacities as follows:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'>Central (Third Av. &amp; 2nd. St.)</td>

    <td class='c006'>Williamsburg (Kent Av. &amp; Rush St.)</td>
    <td class='c010'>182,500 kw.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Power is generated and transmitted at 6600 volts, 25 cycles, three-phase. Owing to the
diversified feeding system it is not possible to estimate the portion used by the elevated and
surface lines. Power for the operation of the Manhattan lines is purchased from the
Interborough Rapid Transit Co.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Substations</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>For supplying 600 volts to the entire system the B.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;T. has in operation 98 synchronous
converter units aggregating 142,500 kw. These units range in size from 500

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c004'>The present Chicago Elevated Railroads are an amalgamation of the four systems
which up to 1911 were operated as independent lines. Under the unified system of
operation a single fare takes the passenger from one end of the system to the other,
except that north of Howard Street on the Evanston line an additional fare is collected.
The longest continuous ride without change is from Wilmette to Jackson Park, a distance
of 24 miles.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first elevated road, afterward known as the South Side Elevated, started operation
in June, 1892, with steam engines. After the successful demonstration on the Intramural
Railway this line was electrified; all steam equipment being withdrawn in 1898.</p>

<p class='c005'>What is now the Chicago and Oak Park Elevated Railroad began operation in 1893
also with steam locomotives. Electrical operation began in September, 1896.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The Metropolitan West Side was originally planned for steam locomotive operation,
but developments in electric traction during the construction period were so rapid that
orders for steam equipment were cancelled and operation began in May, 1895, with electric
equipment.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Northwestern Elevated began operation in May, 1900, and was planned as an
electric rad from the start. In 1897 the “Union Loop” was built to facilitate interchange
of passengers from the different lines, but a separate fare was required on each
road up to 1913.</p>

<p class='c005'>The population served by the Chicago Elevated Lines is estimated at more than
1,000,000 people; the total number of passengers handled annually is about 190,000,000.
Trains of from six to eight cars are operated during rush hour service on a two-minute
headway with a maximum of 72 trains per hour on a track of the loop. Plans are being made
to extend some of the station platforms to permit the use of more than 6- and 8-car trains.</p>

<p class='c005'>An extensive program of improvements to the present rapid transit system has been
proposed, but no definite steps have yet been taken toward authorizing the work. These
plans include a subway section under the present loop district with several additional
elevated lines.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c004'>The present rapid transit facilities of the City of Philadelphia include Market St.
Subway-Elevated line extending East from the 69th St. Terminal to the Delaware
River. The tracks are elevated from 66th St. to 22nd St. and pass in subway under
the business section to another elevated section on Delaware Ave. This line first
began service in 1905 and during the year 1920 handled approximately 80,000,000
passengers.</p>

<p class='c005'>As far back as 1912 an exhaustive study of the city’s transportation facilities was made
and a comprehensive program of extensions was proposed for the rapid transit system.
Owing to legislative delays, and conditions due to the war, progress has been delayed on
this program so that so far only the Frankford Elevated line has been built. This is now
nearly ready for operation, from the foot of Market Street to Frankford, a distance of
6.4 miles all double tracked. Other extensions planned for construction in the near future
include a four-track subway running north and south under Broad Street, and an
elevated line extending from the present Market Street line at West Philadelphia
to Darby.</p>

<p class='c005'>The present elevated-subway system is double tracked throughout and multiple
unit trains up to seven cars each are operated on headways down to two minutes. No
express service is operated, all trains making every stop.</p>

principal power station is at Delaware
Avenue. Steam turbine generating equipment
totalling 58,000 kw. is in service in three stations
and is designed for 13,200 volts 3-phase 25
cycles at which it is transmitted to the substations.
One or two direct-current stations
are still available for supplying 600 volts direct
to the trolley. Power is also purchased from
the Philadelphia Electric Co. and the Philadelphia
Hydro-Electric Co.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Substations</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>The company operates a total of 17 substations used for supplying both surface and
rapid transit lines. These stations contain a total of 65 units aggregating 103,500 kw.</p>

<p class='c005'>Power is distributed to all lines at 600 volts and on the rapid transit lines is collected
from an under running third rail similar to that used on the New York Central Electric
Zone.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><i>Rolling Stock</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>The rolling stock used on the Elevated-Subway line includes 215 motor cars each
equipped with two motors. Trains are made up of all motor cars, no trailers being used.
General Electric motors are used throughout including GE-66 and GE-222. The Frankford
extension will be operated with 100 motor cars each equipped with two GE-259 motors.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
